This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL database running
- `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set

### Database Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up the database:

- Run the database seeding script: `npm run seed`
- This will create all necessary tables and populate them with sample data

### Development Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts for development:

- `npm run seed` - Seed the database with sample data
- `npm run test-order` - Create a test order
- `npm run test-webhook <order_id> <event_type>` - Test Pathao webhook events
- `npm run migrate-courier` - Convert courier status fields to TEXT type
- `npm run reset-sequence <table_name> [value]` - Reset database sequence

### Running the Development Server

After setting up the database, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
